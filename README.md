- `GET /api/users/me` – current user; `PUT /api/users/profile` – update profile fields.
- `POST /api/users/update-avatar` – upload avatar (Multer memory storage → Firebase Storage).
- `POST /api/users/change-password` / `/change-skills` – profile mutations.
- `POST /api/users/favorites/toggle` – save/unsave a job; `DELETE /api/users/delete/:userid` – delete account.
- `POST /api/users/forgot-password` / `/reset-password` – email reset flow.

- `POST /api/travel/batch` – batch transit time + transfer counts for job locations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 24.0.0
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **PostgreSQL** database (Neon DB recommended)
- **Firebase** Firebase service account (as JSON string)
- **SMTP credentials**
- **LinkedIn Job Search RapidAPI key**
- **Google Maps API** key for commute calculations

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HackYourFuture/c53-final-project-group-A.git
   cd c53-final-project-group-A
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

   This will install dependencies for both client and server.

3. **Set up environment variables**

   In client and server directories, copy and rename the `.env.example` files into `.env`. Set all environmental variables.

4. **Run the development servers**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the client (Vite dev server) and server (Express with nodemon) concurrently.

   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (or the port Vite assigns)
   - Backend: http://localhost:3000 (or your configured PORT)

## 📜 Available Root Level Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start both client and server in development mode
- `npm run start` - Start the production server
- `npm run build` - Build the client for production
- `npm run setup` - Install dependencies for both client and server

## 🚢 Deployment

The project is configured for Heroku deployment. The `Procfile` specifies the production start command.

### Heroku Deployment Steps

1. Create a Heroku app
2. Set environment variables in Heroku dashboard
3. Push to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

The `heroku-postbuild` script will automatically:

- Install dependencies
- Build the client application
